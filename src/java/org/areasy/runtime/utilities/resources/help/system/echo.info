Echo
====

Echo action is usually used to check if an AREasy server instance is running or not. If is running the server will return a log message having the following pattern:
	> Echo message from <areasy server hostname>:<areasy server port>

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action echo [-signal] [-inout]

Where:
	-inout  = it is parameter that will print out as a log message all input parameters (from command line) and their values.

	-signal = it is provided to the action to return a data value that is "0". This parameter is usually used to check in real time system interoperability for complex AREasy configuration. As an example this method could be used be AREasy FILTERAPI module in order to send a real message to the Remedy server that AREasy is online and could process external calls.


Examples:
---------
1) areasy -action echo
	= checks server status and returns a log message

2) areasy -action echo
	= checks server status and returns bit 0 as a value if the server is up (otherwise nothing) and server answer into a log message

3) areasy -action echo -inout
	= checks server status and returns input parameters as output value and server status as a log message
