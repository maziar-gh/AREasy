ARSystem Password Encrypt
=========================

The action is able to encode an plain text into an AR System password, to be used in AR environment configurations.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action admin.password.encrypt -password <plain text>

Where:
	-password = this is the string that will be transformed into an AR password

The output of this action is the encoded password or an error message. The right outcome is AREasy data output format, so the action could be used very easy in FILTERAPI workflows.

Examples:
---------
1) areasy -runtime -action admin.password.encrypt -password abc123
	= execute locally the transformation of string 'abc123' into an AR password

2) areasy -action admin.password.encrypt -password abc123
   	= execute on the ARSystem server the transformation of string 'abc123' into an AR password
