Rename Support Group
====================

This action is an ITSM utility, designed to rename a support group by making offline the old group and creating a new one with the specified details.
All related details (e.g. aliases) and memberships are transferred to the new support group.
The power of this action is the replacement procedure of the old support group with the new one in incidents, problems, known errors, changes and asset relationships. In addition, this action applies the specified group transformation to the foundation layer, managing the corresponding templates of ITSM applications and other configurations.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action admin.rename.sgroup -sgroupcompany <current support group company> -sgrouporganisation <current support group organisation> -sgroupname <current support group name> -newsgroupcompany <new support group company> -newsgrouporganisation <new support group organisation> -newsgroupname <new support group name> [-memberships] [-aliases] [-approvalmappings] [-favorites] [-oncalls] [-shifts] [-incidenttemplates] [-incidents [-incidentsbefore <date>] [-incidentsafter <date>] [-openincidents]] [-problemtemplates] [-problems [-problemsbefore <date>] [-problemsafter <date>] [-openproblems]] [-knownerrors [-knownerrorsbefore <date>] [-knownerrorsafter <date>] [-openknownerrors]] [-changetemplates] [-changes [-changesbefore <date>] [-changesafter <date>] [-openchanges]]
