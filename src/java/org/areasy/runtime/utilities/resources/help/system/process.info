Process
=======

Process action has been designed to execute external (operating system) processes.
The process action could be called if the runtime server runs locally or if you'll provide admin credentials (user credentials used to connect to the AR System instance).

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action process -call <command line>

Where:
	-call = it is the parameter that fully describes the external command line.

Attention: if the external command wait an user input the action will remain stacked. For instance, if you'll call a GUI application the action return the control to the runtime manager only when the main process thread is die (when the GUI will be closed).


Examples:
---------
1) areasy -action process -process "sc start AREasy"
	= starts AREasy windows service

2) areasy -action process -process "sc stop AREasy"
	= stops AREasy windows service

3) areasy -action process -process "help"
	= executes and display the output of 'help' Windows command

4) areasy -action process -process "calc.exe"
	= runs Windows Calculator application, waits until it will be close and then will return the control
