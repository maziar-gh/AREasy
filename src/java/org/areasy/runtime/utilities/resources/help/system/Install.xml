Install
=======

Install action has the main scope to install AREasy packages on the local instance (using RUNTIME mode) or a remote AREasy server instance. An installation procedure with this action brings additional resources in configuration area and additional libraries.
An AREasy package is a ARJ file (a Jar archive) that contains resources in maximum four areas:
	- /bin = new or updated binary files
	- /cfg = configuration resources that could be configuration sectors and other files and folders.
	- /doc = documentation and sample files
	- /libs = java libraries (Jar files)that will be appended to the application classpath

During installation process the action will append new configuration sectors in the default.properties and will reload/refresh the entire configuration structure. Also, Java libraries that will be deployed on libraries container will be automatically  loaded without server restart.
After installation the package will be fully functional without server restart. The installation procedure works also for remote server instances.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action package -file <ARJ file> [-environment <environment name>]

Where:
	-file        = ARJ file located on the file system

	-environment = is the name (string code) of the environment that it's used to apply custom configurations. Each environment (production, test, etc.) could have separate and specific configuration and in order to distinguish between them you have to specify a value for this option. By default is considered "production" environment.

Note: Environment option should be used only if you know that your package has been built with specific configuration parameters for your environment (that means if package includes "install[-<environment>].properties" configuration file(s))

Examples:
---------
1) areasy -action install -file c:\\areasy-aar.arj
	= install 'areasy-aar' (AAR) package on the local server instance or using Runtime execution mode.

2) areasy -action install -file c:\\areasy-aar.arj -host VM001 -aruser Demo -arpassword ""
	= install 'areasy-aar' package on a remote server (host is VM001)

3) areasy -action install -file c:\\areasy-aar.arj -environment test -host VM001 -aruser Demo -arpassword ""
	= install 'areasy-aar' package on a remote server (host is VM001) but for testing environment (configuration - will apply all configuration options from "install-test.properties" file, included in the ARJ file)
