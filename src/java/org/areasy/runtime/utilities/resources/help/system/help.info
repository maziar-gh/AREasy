Help
====

Help action shows areasy standard command line and describes all common parameters. Also, using [-inventory] you can get the list of all registered actions.
If in the command line will be included [-call <action name>] will be displayed the help text of returned by that specified action name.
In case of [-call ...] parameter is not specified, Help action displays this text.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy [-runtime|-druntime|-server|-dserver|-dclient] -action <action name> [-param1 value1] [-param2 value2] ... [-paramN valueN valueM]

Below are nominated all standard parameters that are available to almost all actions:
	[-host <areasy server host>]
	[-port <areasy server port>]
	[-arserver <ars server>]
	[-aruser <user name>]
	[-arpassword <user password>]
	[-arport <ars server port>]
	[-notification]
	[-notificationmailbox <value>]
	[-notificationrecipientto <value>]
	[-notificationrecipientcc <value>]
	[-notificationsubject <value>]
	[-loglevel <debug|info|warn|error>]
	[-priority <min|max|norm>]
	[-compactmode]
	[-asynchron]
	[-reportnodata]
	[-reportnolog]
	[-help]

Where:
	-<runtime mode>         = Execution mode parameter. Possible options are: -runtime | -druntime | -server | -dserver | -dclient. Could have one of those options or nothing. For more details see the next paragraph.

	-action                 = It is mandatory parameter that have to be included in any command line. Must have as a value one of the registered actions.

	-host                    = AREasy server host name.

	-port                    = AREasy server TCP port.

	-arserver                = Remedy server name or IP referred by AREasy instance.

	-arport                  = Remedy server TCP port referred by AREasy instance.

	-aruser                  = Remedy account name referred by AREasy instance.

	-arpassword              = Password for Remedy account referred by AREasy instance. The password value could be plain text of obfuscated (encrypted).

	-notification            = This is a parameter that overwrite a standard configuration used to send the data output and the log message via email. The recipients and all the other email details are specified in the configuration files or could be overwritten by the other parameters (see below). The notification body always will contain the data array generated by the action execution and the action log message. In case of you want to include only data or only the log message use -reportnodata and -reportnolog parameters (see below).

	-notificationmailbox     = Overwrites notification details regarding what mailbox name will be used (defined in the Remedy server) to send the notification. This parameter is considered only if parameter -notification is specified.

	-notificationrecipientto = Overwrites notification details regarding TO recipient(s) used in the notification. This parameter is considered only parameter if -notification is specified.

	-notificationrecipientcc = Overwrites notification details regarding CC recipient(s) used in the notification. This parameter is considered only parameter if -notification is specified.

	-notificationsubject     = Overwrites notification details regarding CC recipient(s) used in the notification. This parameter is considered only parameter if -notification is specified.

	-reportnodata            = This parameter is used to not include in the output or in the notification body the data array generated by the action execution.

	-reportnolog             = This parameter is used to not append to the output or to the notification body the log messages generated by the action execution.

	-priority                = Set the priority of the action execution channel. The possible values could be: min (low priority), max (high priority), norm (usual priority).

	-compactmode             = Send the data array from server to the AREasy client as a one data line (all values are concatenated in one line, separated by space character).

	-asynchron               = Launch the action on the server side and don't wait server answer. This parameter works only in client/server mode.

	-loglevel                = Specific logging level applied only for action execution. Also this parameter could be used when the server is started (using "start" action) and will overwrite logging level for the server instance (configured in the main configuration file).

	-help                    = Displays action's help text. In case of other action than "help" will use this option, instead of execute the action the runtime will return the help text of that action.


Execution Mode options:
	-runtime  = runs AREasy in Runtime mode, without using a server instance
	-druntime = the same behavior but starting the runtime in debug mode
	-server   = runs AREasy in Server mode
	-dserver  = runs AREasy in Server mode with debugging on server
	-dclient  = runs AREasy in Client mode with debugging on client

Note: This "execution mode" options have to be the first parameter from the command line and it is optional. If is missing AREasy starts in Client mode. In case you'll execute an action using -runtime option and the default.configuration file doesn't contain a proper remeyd server and credentials for connectivity you have to include in the command line all connectivity options (arserver, arport, aruser and arpassword).

Attention: If any action is executed with -help switch then the action will not be executed and will return the help text message. So, the following expressions are equivalent:
areasy -action help -call <action name> | areasy -action <action name> -help


Examples:
---------
1) areasy -action help
	= displays the whole help text of Help action called from AREasy server. This is a client call to the server that is described in the configuration file

2) areasy -action help -inventory
	= displays the list of registered action on the AREasy server. This is a client call to the server that is described in the configuration file

3) areasy -action help -call data.wrapper.file
	= displays the help text delivered by the data.wrapper.file action, from the server instance described in the configuration file

4) areasy -runtime -action help -inventory
	= display the list of registered action on the local AREasy distribution, called as a Runtime instance

5) areasy -host server100 -action help
	= displays the whole help text of Help action called from 'server100' AREasy server instance. The action is execute on that server and the answer (this help text) is returned in the client console (where this command has been executed)
