Set Support Group Membership
============================

This action is an ITSM utility, designed to transform a normal people account into a support user. This action is able to set the support group membership for one or many people accounts.
Also, this action allows you to specify if the support group is the default one or not or you can set the support staff for all involved people account in this action execution.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action admin.set.sgroup.member [-login <val>] [-logins <val1> <val2> ... <valn>] [-fieldid <CTM:People field id> [-fieldvalue <CTM:People field value>]] [-sgroupcompany <current support group company>] [-sgrouporganisation <current support group organisation>] [-sgroupname <current support group name>] [-sgroupid <support group id>] [-role <Member|Associate Member>] [-default] [-supportstaff]


Where:
	-sgroupcompany      = support group company. In addition the action supports another alias for this option: -supportgroupcompany. This option is used to identify the support group entity

	-sgrouporganisation = support group organisation. In addition the action supports another alias for this option: -supportgrouporganisation. This option is used to identify the support group entity

	-sgroupname         = support group name. In addition the action supports some aliases for these options: -sgroup, -supportgroup, -supportgroupname. This option is used to identify the support group entity

	-sgroupid           = support group id. Also this option has an alias and this is -supportgroupid. So, first four options have to be used to identify the support group entity that will used and membership target entity for specified people account(s)

	-role	            = set the membership role. It could be: Member or Associate Member. By default the action will use Member value.

	-default            = set the identified support group entity as default group. By default this option is not used and the action will follow the foundation workflow (in case of the specified membership is the first one for the specified action(s) will become default group otherwise not)

	-supportstaff       = set with Yes value the Support Staff flag in people profiles for the specified user(s). By default this action runs with this flag, so all memberships will transfform people account in support staff.

	-login              = Remedy user id

	-logins             = list of Remedy user ids

	-userfieldid        = a specific field Id from CTM:People form (or other form in case of 'userformname' option is specified) to the create a qualification criteria to identify the login ids where this permission have to the applied

	-userfieldvalue     = the corresponding value for -fieldid option to compose the qualification criteria: <CTM:People fieldid> = <fieldvalue>. From the found people records will be extracted login ids that will be appended to the specified list through -login(s) option

	-userqualifiation   = this could be the third option to take the list of persons and to provide them additional roles. Actually this option provide a way to select persons using a qualification criteria addressed to the direct connected AR System server.

	-userformname       = in case of 'userqualifiation' is used you can say a value for this option to find the usernames into an independent Remedy form (also you have to use 'userfieldid' to specify the field id that will be read from that form) or don't specify it and will search directly in People form and will read 'Remedy Login ID' field
